SolidusRecommendations
======================

Uses Elasticsearch on top of Solidus framework to retrieve relevant recommendations based on what users have purchased in the past.

Installation
------------

Add solidus_recommendations to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_recommendations'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g solidus_recommendations:install
```

Testing
-------

Install [elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch), this is needed for rspec tests. If you have issues running tests, see [https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/tree/master/elasticsearch-extensions#testcluster](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-ruby/tree/master/elasticsearch-extensions#testcluster)

First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs, and [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rake
```

When testing your applications integration with this extension you may use it's factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'solidus_recommendations/factories'
```
